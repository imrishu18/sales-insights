## üßÆ Data Analysis Using SQL  

Here are a few key SQL queries used for analysis:

```sql
-- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Show all customer records
SELECT * FROM customers;

-- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Show total number of customers
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;

-- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Show transactions for Chennai market
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE market_code = 'Mark001';

-- 4Ô∏è‚É£ Show distinct product codes sold in Chennai
SELECT DISTINCT product_code FROM transactions WHERE market_code = 'Mark001';

-- 5Ô∏è‚É£ Show transactions where currency is USD
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE currency = 'USD';

-- 6Ô∏è‚É£ Show transactions for year 2020
SELECT t.*, d.* 
FROM transactions t
INNER JOIN date d ON t.order_date = d.date
WHERE d.year = 2020;

-- 7Ô∏è‚É£ Show total revenue for year 2020
SELECT SUM(t.sales_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM transactions t
INNER JOIN date d ON t.order_date = d.date
WHERE d.year = 2020 AND (t.currency IN ('INR', 'USD'));

-- 8Ô∏è‚É£ Show total revenue in January 2020
SELECT SUM(t.sales_amount) AS jan_revenue
FROM transactions t
INNER JOIN date d ON t.order_date = d.date
WHERE d.year = 2020 AND d.month_name = 'January'
AND (t.currency IN ('INR', 'USD'));

-- 9Ô∏è‚É£ Show total revenue in Chennai for 2020
SELECT SUM(t.sales_amount) AS chennai_revenue
FROM transactions t
INNER JOIN date d ON t.order_date = d.date
WHERE d.year = 2020 AND t.market_code = 'Mark001';
```
